workflow:


They are interested in:
• the assembled sequences
• a phylogeny
• regions of high and/or low sequence variability



The deliverables are:
• fasta file with the assembled genome for each sequenced strain
• phylogenetic tree in Newick format and visualised in pdf or png format
• text file containing the average sequence variability for each window of length x (x should be a parameter of your workflow)
• plot showing the variability along the sequenced genome (x-axis: genome position, y-axis: variability)


Questions that have to be adressed:
• reference based assembly or de-novo assembly?
• how to measure sequence variability of a single sequence position?
